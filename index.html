            <p>I’ve spent nearly my whole life writing stories. As a kid, I
                was always making things with paper and by first
                grade had determined I wanted to be an artist for our 'what do I want to be when I grow
                up' book.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until middle school that I had the epiphany that game design would be a good fit. I enjoyed
                computer science class because a new avenue of making things opened up. I was never good with
                presentations but I had to make a game and present it to one of my classes and it was the first
                presentation I actually felt confident doing. That coalesced into me trying out a
                technology elective in junior high, and then computer science classes the entirety of my high school in
                Cincinnati, Ohio, where I attended k-12. I now have a minor in computer science and am completing my
                game design major this semester at Miami University.</p>
            <p>My time there allows me to grow both programming wise as well as improving project management skills, teamwork, communication,
                organization, and public speaking. Additionally, I currently work as a student assistant in our school’s
                disability services center. They’ve been an amazing resource for me and I’m incredibly appreciative of
                the position as it teaches me more about accessibility, work environments, and support.</p>
            <p>All of these different experiences, as well as my first job as a teaching assistant in a pre-school
                classroom at my synagogue, have taught me that game design, play, learning, and
                accessibility can all be
                intertwined. Now I want to make games that can achieve that through
                aesthetics, enjoyment, disability representation, accessibility, and education.</p>
