            <p>Early on in my computer science minor I took CSE 251, which was Intro to Game Programming.
                This got
                me familiar with Unity engine as well as programming in C#. My skills have improved a lot since this
                rendition of the game,
                and I'm now working on another iteration in an independent study for my final computer science course
                before graduating.
                I'm going to transition
                the game into Unreal engine and work with C++ and/or blueprints.</p>

            <p>For my first rendition of Finish Lime, I developed artwork, animation systems, particles, scoring,
                saving, exporting
                a build to be played in browser, shooting, power-ups, and enemies. You play as a fruit-themed racer
                trying to last as long as they can
                on the track. By clicking the up
                arrow, you can destroy any rocks that get in your way, or avoid them by using the arrow keys. Different
                lemons fall toward you, allowing you to collect them and giving different
                boosting effects. You have three lives and to replay once they run out simply left-click.
            </p>

            <p>The first iteration was great for learning how to implement systems and for seeing everything come
                together in one of the
                first games I made not on a team. I hope to improve upon everything as I continue working on it. A major
                change is that I want a lot of the gameplay
                to be in 3D, which means I will need to work on improving my skills in Maya and/or Blender. However,
                some of the UI screens will likely be 2D in
                order to showcase the character art. All that really comes across in the current version of the game is
                that there are a lot of lemons. I want to be
                clearer with the aesthetics going forward. I did a lot of character art for Luelle Amon, who you're
                playing as, but you're never introduced to her name
                or anything else about her. I'm also really looking forward into introducing more accessibility features
                and
                disability representation.
            </p>

            <p>To the left and below, you can view different drawing timelapses of and current artwork and models, like
                what I
                made in IMS 319,
                which was Foundations in Digital 3-D Modeling and Animation. More will be coming soon as I continue to
                further develop this project over the course of Spring 2026.
